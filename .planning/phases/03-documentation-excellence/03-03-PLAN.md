**Current README structure:**
- Features list
- Quick Start (live demo, examples, using the tool)
- Usage instructions (MSDS input, tabs walkthrough)
- Development section (minimal - just credits AI assistance)
- Developer Documentation (points to TECHNICAL.md)

**Gaps:**
- No setup instructions for running tests
- No mention of Phase 1-2 improvements (testing, validation)
- Development section needs expansion
- No link to CONTRIBUTING.md (will exist after 03-01)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add development setup section to README</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Expand the "Development" section in README.md to include: (1) Prerequisites (Node.js 16+ for running tests, modern browser for app), (2) Setup steps (git clone, cd into directory, npm install), (3) Running the application (open coshhgeneratorv5.html in browser OR use local server like `python -m http.server 8000`), (4) Running tests (npm test for console output, npm run test:ui for browser UI). Keep it concise - detailed steps should be in CONTRIBUTING.md. Add note: "For detailed contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)". Place this section after "Quick Start" and before detailed "Usage" sections.</action>
  <verify>Development section expanded with setup and test commands; link to CONTRIBUTING.md added</verify>
  <done>README has development setup with prerequisites, setup steps, and testing commands</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update Features section with Phase 1-2 improvements</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Add two new features to the bullet list under "Features" section: (1) "**Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with Vitest ensures reliability and prevents regressions" (added Phase 1, Jan 2026), (2) "**Runtime Safety**: Input validation and error handling provide graceful failure and helpful debugging" (added Phase 2, Jan 2026). Place these after "Lab Procedure Templates" and before any footer content. Keep the same formatting style as existing bullets (bold feature name, description).</action>
  <verify>Two new feature bullets added with consistent formatting</verify>
  <done>Features section updated to reflect testing and safety improvements from Phase 1-2</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add project status and documentation links</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Add new "Project Status" section after "Features" and before "Quick Start". Content: Brief statement that project is actively maintained and being enhanced with testing, documentation, and code quality improvements. Include "Progress: 2 of 6 phases complete" (from ROADMAP.md). Add "Documentation" subsection with links: [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md) for in-depth technical documentation, [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design (new in Phase 3), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines (new in Phase 3), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history. Keep tone positive and professional - this shows the project is maturing.</action>
  <verify>Project Status section exists with progress indicator and documentation links</verify>
  <done>README shows project is actively maintained with clear documentation roadmap</done>
