<objective>
Create comprehensive contribution guidelines that enable new developers to set up the project, run tests, and submit changes following established conventions.

Purpose: Lower the barrier to contribution by documenting setup process, testing workflow, and git conventions established in Phases 1-2.
Output: CONTRIBUTING.md with setup instructions, testing guide, and contribution workflow.

**Tech stack available:**
- Vitest + happy-dom for testing
- ES6 modules (type: "module")
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)

**Established patterns:**
- Test directory: `tests/` at root
- Commit format: `type(scope): description` with Co-Authored-By: Claude
- Pure function extraction for testability
- Git workflow: atomic commits per task

**Key decisions:**
- Phase 1: Used Vitest over Jest (lighter, faster)
- Phase 1: ES6 modules for better organization
- Phase 2: Validation uses guard clauses, specific error types
- Phase 2: DOM helpers with `[DOM]` prefixed warnings

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development setup</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>Create CONTRIBUTING.md with sections: (1) Prerequisites (modern browser, text editor, optional Node.js for tests), (2) Getting Started (clone repo, npm install, run local server with python -m http.server or similar), (3) Running Tests (npm test, npm run test:ui, understanding test output), (4) Project Structure (brief overview pointing to STRUCTURE.md in .planning/codebase/), (5) Making Changes (create branch, make changes, run tests, commit). Use friendly, encouraging tone. Include specific commands that work on Windows (where this project lives). Reference that testing was added in Phase 1 (Jan 2026) and runtime safety in Phase 2.</action>
  <verify>File exists and has all 5 sections with code blocks for commands</verify>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Document git commit conventions</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>Add "Commit Message Format" section to CONTRIBUTING.md. Document the convention: `type(scope): description` with types: feat, fix, test, refactor, docs, style. Include the Co-Authored-By trailer used in this project. Show examples from actual commits (e.g., "feat(02-02): add retry logic to data loaders", "test(01-02): add failing test for severity calculation"). Explain scope format: phase-plan (e.g., 01-02) for GSD commits, or component name (e.g., inventory, parser) for feature work. Keep examples realistic and based on actual Phase 1-2 commits.</action>
  <verify>Section exists with type definitions and realistic examples</verify>
  <done>Commit format documented with examples matching established conventions</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add testing best practices</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>Add "Testing Guidelines" section. Explain: (1) All new functions should have tests (especially calculations and validation), (2) Tests live in tests/ directory with .test.js extension, (3) Use descriptive test names ("should reject negative severity values" not "test1"), (4) Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for business logic (write failing test, implement, refactor), (5) Run tests before committing (npm test). Include note that UI functions can be harder to test - focus on extracted pure functions. Reference domHelpers as example of testable extracted code.</action>
  <verify>Testing section exists with 5 guidelines and practical advice</verify>
  <done>Testing best practices documented with actionable guidance</done>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md exists and is properly formatted markdown
- [ ] All sections present: Prerequisites, Getting Started, Running Tests, Structure, Making Changes, Commit Format, Testing Guidelines
- [ ] Commands are accurate and work on Windows
- [ ] Examples match actual project conventions
- [ ] Tone is welcoming and encouraging
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- CONTRIBUTING.md created with comprehensive setup and workflow guidance
- Development setup instructions include npm install and test commands
- Git commit conventions documented with realistic examples
- Testing guidelines provide actionable advice for contributors
- Document follows markdown best practices with proper headings and code blocks
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-documentation-excellence/03-01-SUMMARY.md`:

# Phase 3 Plan 1: CONTRIBUTING.md Summary

**Contribution guidelines established for developer onboarding**

## Accomplishments

- Created CONTRIBUTING.md with 7 major sections
- Documented development setup (prerequisites, installation, local server)
- Explained testing workflow (running tests, interpreting output)
- Defined git commit conventions with realistic examples
- Provided testing best practices aligned with Phase 1-2 patterns

## Files Created/Modified

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Complete contribution guide (~150-200 lines)

## Decisions Made

[Document any choices made during implementation, or "None"]

## Issues Encountered

[Document any problems and resolutions, or "None"]

## Next Step

Ready for 03-02-PLAN.md (ARCHITECTURE.md) or continue with remaining Phase 3 plans
