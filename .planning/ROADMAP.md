# Roadmap: CABI COSHH Helper

## Overview

Transform a "vibe coded" COSHH assessment generator into a demonstrably maintainable and reliable application that convinces IT to support backend integration. The journey moves from establishing testing and validation infrastructure, through documentation and code quality improvements, to implementing mock user roles and approval workflows that demonstrate the complete vision.

## Domain Expertise

None

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1: Testing Foundation** - Establish automated testing infrastructure
- [ ] **Phase 2: Runtime Safety** - Add validation checks and error handling
- [ ] **Phase 3: Documentation Excellence** - Create comprehensive developer documentation
- [ ] **Phase 4: Code Quality** - Refactor for clarity and maintainability
- [ ] **Phase 5: User Role Simulation** - Implement mock user role system
- [ ] **Phase 6: Approval Workflow UI** - Build mock approval workflow interface

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Testing Foundation
**Goal**: Establish automated testing infrastructure with unit and integration tests for core functionality to prevent regressions when adding features
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Likely (need to choose testing framework for vanilla JS)
**Research topics**: JavaScript testing frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Mocha), mocking strategies for DOM/PDF.js, CI/CD integration options
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 2: Runtime Safety
**Goal**: Add validation checks and error handling throughout the application to catch issues during development and production
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Unlikely (standard validation patterns, error handling conventions)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 3: Documentation Excellence
**Goal**: Create comprehensive developer documentation including architecture guide, contribution guidelines, and setup instructions
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (documentation writing, established patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 4: Code Quality
**Goal**: Refactor for clarity, add meaningful comments, improve error messages, and enhance debugging capabilities
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Research**: Unlikely (refactoring existing code, internal patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 5: User Role Simulation
**Goal**: Implement mock user role system in frontend (COSH assessors, lab managers, admin) to demonstrate workflow vision
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Research**: Unlikely (frontend-only mock implementation, no external dependencies)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 6: Approval Workflow UI
**Goal**: Build mock approval workflow interface (draft → review → approve → publish) to show complete system vision
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Research**: Unlikely (UI implementation following existing patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning
