## 2025-01-20 - Floor Plan Integration Complete

### âœ… Completed Today

#### ChemInventory Integration & Inventory Dashboard
- **Chemical Inventory API Integration**: Successfully integrated ChemInventory API to fetch 541 chemicals
- **Inventory Dashboard**: Created comprehensive inventory management interface with:
  - Statistics cards showing assessment status counts (94 complete, 226 need assessment, 221 not required)
  - Searchable/filterable table with all chemical data
  - Status badges (complete, in progress, needs assessment, review due)
  - Action buttons (Create Assessment, View Assessment, MSDS Download, Details)
- **Pre-fill Assessments**: Clicking "Create Assessment" from inventory pre-fills the COSHH form with chemical data
- **MSDS Download**: Integrated MSDS file download from ChemInventory (requires local proxy for now)
- **Assessment Status Tracking**: Auto-generated tracking system linking inventory to COSHH assessments

#### Interactive Floor Plan Viewer
- **SVG Floor Plan Display**: Full-screen modal viewer for building floor plans (Ground & First Floor)
- **Room Detection**: Intelligent room detection from Inkscape labels (supports formats: room-E1.8, Room_E1.07, etc.)
- **Color-Coded Status**: Rooms highlighted by assessment status:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = All assessments complete
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = In progress
  - ðŸ”´ Red = Needs assessment
  - âšª Gray = No hazards/not required
- **Interactive Navigation**:
  - Hover tooltips showing chemical counts and status breakdown
  - Click room to filter inventory table by location
  - Zoom controls (+, -, reset)
  - Pan functionality for large floor plans
- **Smart Integration**: Clicking a room closes floor plan, switches to Inventory tab, and filters table by room code

#### Technical Fixes
- Fixed API authentication and data format parsing (columns/rows structure)
- Fixed event delegation for dynamically created inventory buttons
- Fixed hazard display using H-codes from hazardStatements
- Fixed field IDs for assessment pre-fill (chemicalName, taskDescriptionTextarea)
- Fixed global variable access between inventory-manager.js and floor-plan-viewer.js
- Fixed timing issue where room interactivity wasn't applied on initial floor plan load
- Added room code normalization (E1.07 â†’ E1.7) to match inventory format

### ðŸ“Š Current State

**Data Files:**
- `data/inventory/chemical-inventory.json` - 541 chemicals from ChemInventory
- `data/tracking/assessment-status.json` - Status tracking for all chemicals

**New Features:**
- Inventory tab with full chemical database
- Floor plan viewer with interactive room highlighting
- Seamless workflow: Floor Plan â†’ Click Room â†’ Filter Inventory â†’ Create Assessment

**Admin Tools:**
- `admin-scripts/fetch-inventory.js` - Fetch latest data from ChemInventory API
- `admin-scripts/generate-status.js` - Auto-generate assessment tracking

### ðŸ”® Future Roadmap

#### Short-term (Next Session)
1. **Procedure Optimization**
   - Dedicated Import/Export buttons for procedures
   - Multi-step procedures (e.g., "Make up buffer" â†’ "Use buffer in solution")
   - Aggregate risk matrix for multi-step procedures
   - Procedure templates and library

2. **Automation**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for daily inventory sync
   - Automated assessment status updates
   - Scheduled data refresh without manual intervention

#### Long-term Goals
1. **Backend Integration**
   - Proper backend server (Node.js/Python)
   - Two-way sync with ChemInventory
   - Push completed COSHH assessments back to ChemInventory
   - Real-time updates instead of daily sync

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - User authentication and permissions
   - Audit trail for assessment changes
   - Email notifications for review due dates
   - Advanced reporting and analytics
   - Mobile-responsive design

3. **Procedure Management**
   - Procedure version control
   - Approval workflow for procedures
   - Link procedures to multiple chemicals
   - Copy/clone existing procedures

### ðŸ›  Manual Update Process (Current)

To update inventory data from ChemInventory:
```bash
cd admin-scripts
node fetch-inventory.js --token ../api-token.txt
```

Then refresh the browser to see updated data.
