/**
 * Control Band Data Configuration
 *
 * This file defines the control measures and PPE recommendations for each control band
 * in the HSE COSHH Essentials control banding system.
 *
 * Control Bands:
 * - Band 1: Low hazard + low exposure = General ventilation
 * - Band 2: Moderate hazard/exposure = Engineering controls (LEV)
 * - Band 3: High hazard/exposure = Containment required
 * - Band 4: Very high hazard/exposure = Specialist advice needed
 * - Band S: Special cases (carcinogens, mutagens, respiratory sensitizers)
 *
 * Each band specifies:
 * - general: The primary control measure checkbox identifier
 * - ppeSheet: The PPE guidance sheet reference
 * - ppeText: Detailed PPE recommendations for this control band
 *
 * @type {Object.<string, {general: string, ppeSheet: string, ppeText: string}>}
