# CABI COSHH Helper

A web-based tool to streamline the creation of COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) assessments for laboratory environments.

## Features

- **MSDS Parsing**: Automatically extract hazard information from Material Safety Data Sheets (PDF or text)
- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Intelligent calculation of risk levels based on hazards, quantities, and procedures
- **Control Suggestions**: Automated recommendations for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and control measures
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate professional COSHH assessment reports ready for print or PDF export
- **Data Management**: Save, load, and export assessment data in JSON format
- **Lab Procedure Templates**: Pre-configured common laboratory procedures with exposure factors

## Quick Start

### Try the Live Demo
Visit the live application: **https://miguel-bonnin.github.io/CABI-COSHH-Helper/coshhgeneratorv5.html**

### Try the Example
Want to see how it works? Check out the example files in the `examples/` folder:
- **HiDi Formamide.pdf** - Example MSDS sheet to upload and parse
- **cabi_coshh_dynamic_2025-10-07.json** - Pre-filled assessment data to import
- **coshhform-hidi.pdf** - Completed COSHH report output

These example files are also linked directly in the application's MSDS tab.

### Using the Tool

1. **Open the Application**: Simply open `coshhgeneratorv5.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
2. **Upload MSDS**: Start by uploading a PDF MSDS or pasting text in the MSDS tab
3. **Review Parsed Data**: Check and edit the automatically extracted hazard information
4. **Complete the Form**: Follow the numbered tabs (1-8) to complete your assessment
5. **Generate Report**: Create your final COSHH assessment report ready for review and printing
