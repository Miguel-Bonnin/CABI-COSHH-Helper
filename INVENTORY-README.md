## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript + HTML/CSS (works on GitHub Pages)
- **Data Storage:** Static JSON files in Git repository
- **ChemInventory Integration:** Node.js script (admin only)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (free static hosting)

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
- API tokens must NEVER be committed to the repository
- Only administrators need ChemInventory API access
- End users interact only with static JSON files
- Consider repository privacy if data is sensitive

## Status Values

| Status | Description | Badge Color |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `complete` | Assessment done and current | Green ‚úì |
| `in_progress` | Being worked on | Orange ‚è≥ |
| `needs_assessment` | Requires COSHH assessment | Red ‚ö† |
| `not_required` | Non-hazardous | Gray - |
| `review_due` | Past review date | Blue üìÖ |

## Future Roadmap

Potential enhancements (feedback welcome):

1. **Auto-update tracking** - Script to scan assessment files and update status
2. **Export to Excel** - Generate reports for management
3. **Email notifications** - Alert when reviews are due
4. **Assignment system** - Assign chemicals to specific team members
5. **Backend option** - Move to Vercel/Netlify for real-time updates

## Troubleshooting

### Inventory not loading?
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify JSON files exist in `data/` folders
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### API script failing?
- Verify API token is valid and has admin privileges
- Check network connectivity to ChemInventory
- Ensure Node.js is installed

### Assessment not pre-filling?
- Check chemical IDs match between inventory and status files
- Verify inventory-manager.js is loading in browser console
